# Car_prediction_based_model
In this project we have a dataset regarding car price so, what we have to do is based on these columns ( selling price , present price kms driven , fule type , seller type , transmission and owner(how many owners in the past) ) we have to predict what should be the current selling price of that car.

1: As we know this is kind of supervised ML problem because in this we have labeled data as well as we also have input and output.

2: And we also know that this is regression problem because target variable (selling_prce) is a continious variable.

3: As this is not a complex dataset so, in this dataset no missing values and also i have not preformed EDA because it is 
straight forword dataset and lots of informations i got from .describe().

4: Here I have used Random Forest Regressor Model which gave be a better accuracy() with respect to the Liner Regression model.
